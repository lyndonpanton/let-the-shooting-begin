# let-the-shooting-begin
 An optional project of the "C# Class Development" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" Specialization by the University of Colorado via Coursera

## Description

Project Description  

You're still building the simplified version of the classic arcade game Asteroids. You won't actually complete the full version of the game until next week, but game developers typically break their game development into a number of increments. This project is the fourth increment in your development of this game; you're almost there!

Specifically, your solution needs to:

    Have the ship shoot bullets in the direction the ship is facing

    Make sure the ship doesn't collide with bullets

    Make bullets destroy asteroids

    Make bullets destroy themselves after 2 seconds

    Make bullets screen wrap

    Make it so bullets don't collide with each other

Testing Your Game

Here are the rubrics we used in previous versions of the course to confirm that the game functioned correctly:

    Bullets fire in the direction the ship is facing (close is good enough for this, perfection isn’t required)  

    Bullets don’t destroy the ship

    Bullets destroy asteroid

    Bullets are removed after approximately 2 second

    Bullets screen wrap properly
